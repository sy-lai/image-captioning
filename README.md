# Image captioning
Image Captioning with Conditioned LSTM Generators using flickr
```
Create matrices of image representations using an off-the-shelf image encoder.
Read and preprocess the image captions.
Write a generator function that returns one training instance (input/output sequence pair) at a time.
Train an LSTM language generator on the caption data. Write a decoder function for the language generator.
Add the image input to write an LSTM caption generator. Implement beam search for the image caption generator.
```
